    The song “Kyouran Hey Kids!!” by THE ORAL CIGARETTES speaks of the chaos and confusion experienced by the group’s generation, 
    who are trying to find their place in society. Through the lyrics, it is suggested that the youth of today should accept the 
    chaos and craziness of life and use it to their advantage, instead of trying to close their eyes and run away. The chorus, 
    “Kyouran Hey Kids!" expresses their determination and will to take control of their future, no matter the craze and uncertainty in the present. 
    They remain hopeful that they can continue to search for and find the love they desire, even if the future is uncertain. Ultimately, 
    they want to hold onto the “hero” that they believe will bring them together and lead them to a better tomorrow.
