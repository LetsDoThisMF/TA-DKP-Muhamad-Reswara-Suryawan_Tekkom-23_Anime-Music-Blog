    The song is based on the concept of "farewell peculiar to youth". In producing the music, Kitani received an offer from the anime production side, "A song with a refreshing impression based on the theme of youth". He said it was difficult. The school chime (Westminster Quarters) phrase is used in part of the song. Revealing the changes that have sprouted in order to save memories of youth and "deliver".[8]
    Kitani was able to quickly create something like the first seed for "Ao no Sumika", but it was difficult after that. The first arrangement of this song was completely different, with a slower BPM, more sad elements, and a bit of a guitar on a club beat. The singer tried to make a version that was closer to that, and what he came up with was a guitar rock with a fast BPM and a sense of speed. When asking the director to listen to those two, he said, "It's about the middle." After all, the melody and lyrics are the same, the finished product was different. Eve's "Kaikai Kitan" was a major inspiration for the song. "Scar", which he wrote as the first opening theme song for the Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War anime television series, is one of them, and when he was writing the chorus of "Ao no Sumika", Kitani was thinking about that. Straight as much as possible, twisted in other places. At the beginning of the song, there is a sound like "Corn!" which makes the listener feel like they are back in the womb. When people put in that kind of sound effect to attract the listener and help grow up.[9]
    For Jujutsu Kaisen, the video primarily deals with the youth of Gojo and Geto with an emphasis on blue backgrounds like the lyrics say. The opening contrasts the ending theme "Light" which uses a more relaxed melody which also makes emphasis on Gojo and Geto's friendship. Collab Cafe praised the opening as it will make people listen to it several times
